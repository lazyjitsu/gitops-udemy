In training we forked two repos: infrastrcture repo (iac-vprofile) and app repo (vprofile-action)
(all branches)

Setup your ssh keys of course in github settings
(may need to run sshkeygen)

cloned both branches for training it was:
`git clone git@github.com:devops4sure/iac-vprofile.git` 
`git clone git@github.com:devops4sure/vprofile-action.git`

So we forked them onto our own github account because we need the rights to play with github actions etc..besides,we wouldn't want to mess w/anybody elses repo!  

We want to make sure we are sunig the ssh keys we created. Lets run this command to ensure 

`cd iac-vprofile/`
# where actions is where the private keys is`
`git config core.shCommand "ssh -i ~/.ssh/actions -F /dev/null"`
# obviously, replace devops4sure w/your own id
`git config --global user.name devops4sure`
`git config --global user.email devops4sure@gmail.com`
# Udemy wanted us to copy the repo like so but that's cause they didn't trust us switch branches IMO

`cp -r iac-vprofile main-iac`
`cd iac-vprofile`
`git branch -a`
# this will output two branches: stage and main
`git checkout stage` # this will checkout stage and set the local stage to track/point to the remote github stage branch
`git status`
We will be making changes to the staging branch. If it works, we'll merge into main
