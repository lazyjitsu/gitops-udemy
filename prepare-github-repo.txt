# This document is sort of my 2nd attempt at documenting the steps in some sort of high-level disussion on the subject.
In training we forked two repos: infrastrcture repo (iac-vprofile) and app repo (vprofile-action)
(all branches)

Setup your ssh keys of course in github settings
(may need to run sshkeygen)

cloned both branches for training it was:
`git clone git@github.com:devops4sure/iac-vprofile.git` 
`git clone git@github.com:devops4sure/vprofile-action.git`

So we forked them onto our own github account because we need the rights to play with github actions etc..besides,we wouldn't want to mess w/anybody elses repo!  

We want to make sure we are sunig the ssh keys we created. Lets run this command to ensure 

`cd iac-vprofile/`
# where actions is where the private keys is`
`git config core.shCommand "ssh -i ~/.ssh/actions -F /dev/null"`
# obviously, replace devops4sure w/your own id
`git config --global user.name devops4sure`
`git config --global user.email devops4sure@gmail.com`
# Udemy wanted us to copy the repo like so but that's cause they didn't trust us switch branches IMO

`cp -r iac-vprofile main-iac`
`cd iac-vprofile`
`git branch -a`
# this will output two branches: stage and main
`git checkout stage` # this will checkout stage and set the local stage to track/point to the remote github stage branch
`git status`
We will be making changes to the staging branch. If it works, we'll merge into main

Goto AWS and create user and give user administrative rights. We're using administrative rights for simplicity. In real world, you would reduce the amount of permissions. Generate access key for API usage.

We will be creating some secrets on Github path given above of course. 
Create Secret > Name [AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY]
Value [$hashValofUsr]
Do the same in the other repo

Now create the S3 Bucket for the Terraform state file
  - some unique name like 'BUCKET_TF_STATE_123' or whatever
Create another Secret 
name[BUCKET_TF_STATE123]
Sect[$hashValofUsr]

ECR Create a Repository in ECR

Name[vprofileapp]
Copy the ECR URI


On gihub, create another secret
Name[REGISTRY]
Sect[$value up the amazonaws.com <remove the /.* after /vprofileapp we removed in our case]

Not sure if i misseed some steps but the IAC repo (infrastructure) should have the following sects:

So we should now have 3 secrets on Github:
  1. AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID (this is a hash value that represents the key). It's called 'Access Key' on AWS
  2. AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY (this is the corresponding value/sect for 'Access Key' 
  3. BUCKET_TF_STATE

The App Repo should have:
  1. AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
  2. AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
  3. REGISTRY

## Terraform
Using for installing VPC infrastructure (subnets, instances, i think vpc else using default, sec groups etc..) and the EKS cluster on top of it.
Caution: Since we are running from Github, Udemy has taken caution and not to develop this over stages for tutorial purposes. This is because of something went wrong
from Github to AWS, we may think that we fixed it but then another cluster might be created unbeknownst to us and this is a bit expensive.
