We will create AWS access keys, an S3 bucket and ECR repository on AWS Cloud

Note we will create an IAM user account, generate the access key and place it here. we will NOT keep it on our machine or any github repo!!
github repo (e.g. iac-vprofile) --> settings >> Secrets and variables > actions >
